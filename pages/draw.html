		  				<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
		  				<p>The purpose of this collection is primarily to gather drawings to populate the gallery section of Draw Your Loneliness, which is a part of my Graphic Design undergraduate student thesis project. <b>Participation is voluntary and will take less than ten minutes of your time.</b> It includes drawing your loneliness, saving the image to your desktop, and submitting it via email. Secondarily, you will be helping me test the user experience of the website.</p>
		  				<br><br>
		  				<h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
						<p>Your participation will provide valuable drawings to the gallery and suggestions that may make the overall experience of the website more refined. There are no risks associated with participation as <b>no personal information (name, email addresses, etc.) will be published.</b> Note that when you choose to save your drawing, it only saves it to your desktop. In other words, only you have a copy of your drawing. That is the reason, we are requesting your submission to include it in the gallery.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h3>OUTPUTS</h3>
						<p>The results of this participation may be published in my student thesis, in reports, and/or presentations and colloquia. The final thesis will appear in my personal website and it might also be part of the graduating exhibition (GradEx) at OCAD U.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h3>CONSENT</h3>
						<p>By submitting your drawings, you agree to participate in the collection described above, and that <b>your drawings will appear in the gallery space without attribution or other personal identifiers. </b>
						<br><br>
						You agree that you have had the opportunity to receive additional details about the collection, and understand that you may ask questions in the future and request to take your drawing out of the gallery.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h3>ACCESS</h3>
						<p>Access to your message with drawings, captions, and feedback is restricted to myself, Eldrin Banares, and the Faculty Supervisor Professor Isabel Meirelles. If you have any questions about this request for collection, feel free to contact myself at <a href="mailto:eldrin.banares@student.ocadu.ca">eldrin.banares@student.ocadu.ca</a> or Prof. Meirelles at <a href="mailto:imeirelles@faculty.ocadu.ca">imeirelles@faculty.ocadu.ca</a>.</p>
						<br><br>
