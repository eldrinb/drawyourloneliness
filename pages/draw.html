		  				The purpose of this collection is to primarily gather drawings and secondarily test the user experience of the website. These drawings will populate the gallery section of Draw Your Loneliness, which is a part of my Graphic Design undergraduate student thesis project. Participation will take less than ten minutes of your time. 
		  				<br><br>
						Participating will provide valuable drawings to the gallery and suggestions that may make the overall experience of the website more refined. There are no risks associated with participation as <b>no personal information (name, email addresses, etc.) will be kept.</b>
						<br><br>
						The results of this participation may be published in my student thesis, in reports, and/or presentations and colloquia. The final thesis will appear in my personal website and it might also be part of the graduating exhibition (GradEx) at OCAD U.
						<br><br>
						By submitting your drawings, you agree to participate in the collection described above. You agree that you have had the opportunity to receive additional details about the collection, and understand that you may ask questions in the future and request to take your drawing out of the gallery.
						<br><br>
						Access to these drawings, captions, and feedback is restricted to myself, Eldrin Banares, and the Faculty Supervisor Professor Isabel Meirelles. If you have any questions about this request for collection, feel free to contact myself at <a href="mailto:eldrin.banares@student.ocadu.ca">eldrin.banares@student.ocadu.ca</a> or Prof. Meirelles at <a href="mailto:imeirelles@faculty.ocadu.ca">imeirelles@faculty.ocadu.ca</a>.
